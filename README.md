# terminal-files
Replace your Ubuntu files with these and we can use them as a default!<br>
**üõ†Ô∏è Commands**
1. Close any open ubuntu windows
2. Open ubuntu
3. Copy and Paste this command
`curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aar9nk/terminal-files/master/{.bashrc,.git-completion.bash,.git-prompt.sh,.profile}" -o ~/#1 && rm -f ~/.bash_profile`
4. Press Enter and wait for it to finish
5. Close Ubuntu and open it again.
This will give you:
An updated terminal window, you will now see just your username as well as the current directory git information in a git repository, like on udacity, you should see the branch name when you are in a git repository. <br>
The open command, which can open a file in its default program, for example, `open index.html`<br>

**Now that this is complete:**<br>
Do not edit or create .bash_profile , even if a udacity course says to! <br>
Make any changes that udacity says to go in .bash_profile, in .bashrc! <br>
REPEAT: .bashrc IS NOW YOUR .bash_profile!<br>
If you are editing .bashrc  make any edits right at the bottom of the file, you will see a message saying "Anything extra goes down here!"
